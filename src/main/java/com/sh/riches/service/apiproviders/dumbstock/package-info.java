 * "exchange": "NYSE" }, { "ticker": "AA", "name": "Alcoa Corporation",
 * "is_etf": null, "exchange": "NYSE" }, ... ] JSON values & caveats ticker -
 * some exchanges use numbers instead of letters
 *
 * name - may be blank for certain asian exchanges whose names have no english
 * equivalent
 *
 * is_etf - if null, then no information was available
 *
 * exchange - self explanatory
 *
 * Query Parameters filters countries (csv) - list of countries codes (and EU).
 * ie countries=US,CA,EU. Mutually exclusive with exchanges filter
 *

 *
 * is_etf (boolean) - only return stock that are reported as etfs.
 *
 * name_search (string) - like search over the full names of companies
 *

 *
 * Example- find all stocks in North America where the ticker contains "AA"
 * https://dumbstockapi.com/stock?countries=CA,US&ticker_search=AA
 *
 * [
 * {
 * "ticker": "AA", "name": "Alcoa Corporation Common Stock ", "is_etf": false,
 * "exchange": "NASDAQ" }, { "ticker": "AAB", "name": "Aberdeen International
 * Inc.", "is_etf": false, "exchange": "TSX" } ... ] formats format (enum) - can
 * be one of json, csv, tickers-only. default json.
 *
 * âš  If using tickers-only, duplicate tickers will be squashed into one. IE, the
 * stock CAE exists in three different stock exchanges; twice as Canadian
 * company CAE Inc and once as Australian company Cannindah Resources Ltd, but
 * it will only appear in the array once. It may make sense to use tickers-only
 * with a set exchange in mind, or a country where symbols tend not to clash.
